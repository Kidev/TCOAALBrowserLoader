/*:
 * @plugindesc Seamless world: keeps the player centered and cross-fades every
 * door transfer so adjacent maps feel like one continuous space.
 * @author kidev
 *
 * @help
 * TCOAAL is built from many small maps wired together with Transfer Player
 * events. By default each transfer hard-cuts to black and rebuilds the next
 * map, which makes the seams obvious. This plugin hides the seams in two ways:
 *
 *   1. Soft-centered camera. The view follows the player so they sit (mostly)
 *      in the middle of the screen instead of the map scrolling to its edges.
 *      A small overscroll margin is allowed so the camera can drift a little
 *      past a map edge; beyond that it stops, so you never see a big empty
 *      void around tiny rooms. Maps smaller than the screen stay centered.
 *
 *   2. Seamless transitions. RPG Maker has no global layout, so two maps can
 *      never be stitched together permanently with correct geometry. But at a
 *      transfer the destination map is already the real next room. So instead
 *      of fading to black, we snapshot the room we are leaving, build the new
 *      (centered) map underneath it, and cross-dissolve the snapshot away. The
 *      two rooms blend in place, with no black gap, so it reads as one space.
 *
 *   3. Approach preview. As the player comes within PREVIEW_RANGE tiles of a
 *      door, the destination map's real background (its <ground>/<par>
 *      parallax art) fades into the void beyond the current map's edge, so you
 *      can see into the next room before crossing. The preview also includes the
 *      next room's contents -- its events (NPCs, item sprites, props), each drawn
 *      with its current graphic (the active page, evaluated against the live game
 *      state). Ground, events and par are composited into a single bitmap in the
 *      true in-game stack order (ground -> events -> par) and faded as ONE sprite,
 *      so the room fades in as one coherent translucent image (fading the layers
 *      separately superposes their alphas over the void and ghosts/darkens).
 *      The preview sits behind the current map's ground layer, so it only ever
 *      shows through the empty void at an edge -- a door in the middle of a room
 *      reveals nothing, which is exactly right. The neighbour map data is fetched
 *      (and decrypted by the Service Worker / server) and cached once per session.
 *
 *   4. Cross-boundary click-to-move. Clicking into a neighbour's preview (the
 *      "dark" past an edge) means "walk into that room and over to there": the
 *      clicked tile is translated into the neighbour's coordinates, the click
 *      still walks you to the door + transfer, and the new scene resumes pathing
 *      to that tile -- so you don't stop on the seam, you land where you pointed
 *      and keep moving. These walked transfers use a "walk into the next room"
 *      visual instead of the dissolve: the live new map (with the player) fades
 *      in over the old room, which sits underneath and scrolls with you (correct
 *      z-order, translates with the player). Needs click-to-move (MouseControl).
 *
 * Fades handled: ordinary "normal" (black, fadeType 0) transfers get the
 * crossfade. Some doors instead bake their own Fadeout/Fadein Screen around the
 * transfer; those are classified by what sits between the fade-out and the
 * transfer -- a "plain" door (no scripted motion/animation/pictures) has its
 * manual fade skipped and crossfades seamlessly too, while a "scripted" door
 * (the fade is hiding teleports, animations, etc.) is left exactly as authored
 * (and the crossfade stands down so it doesn't fight the black fade). White
 * fades (fadeType 1, dramatic cuts) and bare instant swaps are left alone.
 * Scripted camera scrolls (Scroll Map during cutscenes) are respected too: the
 * centering steps aside while one runs and eases back afterwards.
 *
 * No engine files are modified; everything here is an additive prototype
 * override, so the plugin is safe to enable/disable per the mod system.
