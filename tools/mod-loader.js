 *
 * How it differs from tools/mod-apply.js
 * --------------------------------------
 * mod-apply overlays a mod ONTO the player's game and keeps a rollback
 * archive as the only way back. That is what the first installer did, and it
 * is why a Steam file check could undo a mod, why two mods could not coexist,
 * and why a failed uninstall left a damaged copy of a paid game.
 *
 * This tool never writes to the game. Everything it owns lives in ONE folder
 * next to www/:
 *
 *   <game>/addons/state.json        enabled mods and their load order
 *   <game>/addons/<id>/             the package, its manifest, icon and theme
 *   <game>/addons/.profile/         the tree the game is actually launched from
 *
 * The profile is a mirror of the game folder built out of HARDLINKS (symlinks
 * where hardlinks are unavailable), so it costs no disk space and holds no
 * copy of the game's content. Only the files a mod changes are turned into
 * real files, and always by REMOVING the link first and creating a new file -
 * never by writing through it, which would write straight into the original.
 * That single rule is what keeps the Steam copy pristine, so it is asserted by
 * tools/test-mod-loader.js rather than left to review.
 *
 * The profile is a complete game root (the game's own executable and its
 * package.json are mirrored too) so the game is launched from the profile and
 * NW.js resolves `main` next to that package.json. No command-line app path,
 * no assumption about how the runtime was packaged.
