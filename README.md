# kidev's TCOAAL Browser Loader

**You must OWN the game: this tool only allows you to make it playable on a browser**

A browser tool to play [_The Coffin of Andy and Leyley_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2378900/The_Coffin_of_Andy_and_Leyley/) (by _Nemlei_) from the browser.  
Game files stay on your device. Works on desktop and mobile (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari), and can be installed as an Android app or a PWA.

## Loader features

- **Play in browser** - import your own copy (folder or `.zip`) once via `loader.html`, then just open the page to play. No Node/NW.js required.
- **Offline play** - after the first import, a Service Worker serves every game file locally; the game keeps working with no connection.
- **Multiple versions** - import several builds of the game side by side and switch between them; a guided wizard can drive your own Steam client (via `steam://` console commands) to download older depots for mods that need a specific version.
- **Mods** - browse and install community overhauls, translations and plugins from the in-game **Mods** menu. Overhauls are exclusive (one active at a time), plugins can be combined freely, and saves are kept isolated per active mod.
- **Modding menu** - a full point-and-click modding suite in the loader itself, no coding or local tools required: pick any imported game version and recover it as an editable RPG Maker MV project (download as a `.zip`), edit it in the actual editor, then package your edits into a shareable `.tcoaalmod`. Building compares your project against the game versions you pick and keeps only your changes, so the mod file is copyright-safe to distribute (no game assets inside). Other players install it with a drop, same as any other mod.
- **Data management** - clear/reset all browser data for a fresh start; save files can be exported and re-imported independently of the browser profile.

## Game additions

Quality-of-life features layered on top of the original game, available regardless of which mod (if any) is active:

- **Save anytime, even mid-scene** - Escape opens the pause menu at any point during a CG or line of dialogue, not just on a quiet map like stock RPG Maker requires. You're never stuck without a way to save because a cutscene is running.
- **Saves keep the exact line** - saving while a message is on screen stores that exact line; loading the save resumes right there instead of skipping ahead to the next command like a naive save/load would.
- **Save annotations** - press `[N]` on any save slot (or long-press it on touch) to add or edit a free-form note right on the row; new saves are auto-labeled with their creation time until you overwrite the note yourself.
- **Save preview** - the Continue screen renders a real snapshot of each save (map, characters, on-screen dialogue) instead of a blank/generic background.
- **Instant drag & drop loading** - drop a `.rpgsave` (or a legacy `.json` export) anywhere on the window and it loads immediately, jumping straight into that save.
- **Save export/import** - export any save, or all of them at once, as standard `.rpgsave` files you can back up or move to another browser/device.
- **Quick save** - a dedicated key (`M`) or on-screen button saves instantly to a new file slot without opening the menu.
- **Infinite save slots** - the stock 30/50-slot cap is removed; the save screen scrolls to as many files as you make.
- **Achievements** - Steam achievements are replaced with a local unlock system and an on-screen toast, so progress tracking works without Steamworks.
